# Turkish-Bean-Variety-Classification-

# Problem Statement
Develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the seven most well-known types of dry beans in Turkey (Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermason, Horoz, Seker, and Sira) based solely on the dimension and shape features of the beans. The goal is to create a model that can differentiate between the different types of beans using only internal characteristics, such as form, shape, type, and structure, without relying on any external discriminatory features. The project aims to find the best machine learning algorithm that can effectively classify the beans based on these specific features.

# Data Set Information

Seven different types of dry beans were used in this project, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation. Use best machine learning algorithm to classify the most well-known 7 types of beans in Turkey; Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermason, Horoz, Seker and Sira, depending only on dimension and shape features of bean varieties with no external discriminatory features.

# Features Information

|Feature | Detail|
|----------|-------|
| Area (A)| The area of a bean zone and the number of pixels within its boundaries.|
| Perimeter (P)| Bean circumference is defined as the length of its border.|
| Major axis length (L)| The distance between the ends of the longest line that can be drawn from a bean.|
|Minor axis length (l)| The longest line that can be drawn from the bean while standing perpendicular to the main axis.|
| Aspect ratio (K)| Defines the relationship between L and l.|
| Eccentricity (Ec)| Eccentricity of the ellipse having the same moments as the region.|
| Convex area (C)| Number of pixels in the smallest convex polygon that can contain the area of a bean seed.|
|Equivalent diameter (Ed)|The diameter of a circle having the same area as a bean seed area.|
| Extent (Ex)| The ratio of the pixels in the bounding box to the bean area.|
|Solidity (S)| Also known as convexity. The ratio of the pixels in the convex shell to those found in beans.|
| Roundness (R)| Calculated with the following formula: (4piA)/(P^2)|
|Compactness (CO)| Measures the roundness of an object: Ed/L|
| ShapeFactor1| (SF1)|
|ShapeFactor2 |(SF2)|
|ShapeFactor3| (SF3)|
|ShapeFactor4 (SF4)|
|Class| (Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermosan, Horoz and Sira)|
